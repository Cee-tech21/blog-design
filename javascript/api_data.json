The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">South Korea&#8217;s consolidations appear to start in the shared micromobility industry after many e-scooter players jumped into the sector in 2019, Yoon said in an interview with TechCrunch. Gbike has been approached by potential buyers to be acquired while the startup was looking for acquisition targets itself, Yoon said, adding that it is in talks with another company to acquire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This year might be the time for consolidation [in the e-scooter industry],&#8221; Yoon said. &#8220;We are very open to any other opportunity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The ZET team will not join Gbike&#8217;s team and will remain at Hyundai, Yoon noted. The acquisition brings the startup&#8217;s total vehicle size up to about 45,000. (Gbike, which added a fleet of 20,000 e-scooters last year, will acquire ZET&#8217;s fleet of fewer than 1,000 e-scooters.)\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In 2019, Hyundai launched the ZET platform that enables anyone to start a micromobility business in their cities. ZET operates its service in South Korea\u2019s major cities, including Jeju, Daegu and Incheon. Yoon explained that ZET is like a micromobility franchise platform, making it easier for franchisees to launch their own business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Yoon pointed out that many e-scooter companies suspended or closed last year because of South Korea&#8217;s revised regulation, which took effect in May 2021, that requires e-scooter users to wear a helmet and have a valid driver&#8217;s license and be 16 years or older.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">More than 20 e-scooter rental startups are operating over 50,000 e-scooters in Seoul, South Korea&#8217;s capital. Several e-scooter companies, like Lime, Wind Mobility, Neuron and local companies have shut down their operations in South Korea in the past few months. Regulatory shortfalls in the country, like the lack of a request-for-proposal (RFP) system, which selects a few outstanding operators in each city to deliver the best possible micromobility services, caused rider compliance issues like parking and congestion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Gbike has raised a total of $10 million from investors, including Mirae Asset Venture Investment, Strong Ventures and SBI Investment.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"XYPOHyzUBH\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/22\/lime-suspends-operations-in-south-korea-due-to-chaotic-scooter-environment\/\">Lime suspends operations in South Korea due to &#8220;chaotic scooter environment&#8221;<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Lime suspends operations in South Korea due to &#8220;chaotic scooter environment&#8221;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/22\/lime-suspends-operations-in-south-korea-due-to-chaotic-scooter-environment\/embed\/#?secret=9JX7pHXVKI#?secret=XYPOHyzUBH\" data-secret=\"XYPOHyzUBH\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"94BQBBH5yo\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/24\/singapore-based-micromobility-startup-beam-secures-93m-series-b-enters-new-markets\/\">Singapore-based micromobility startup Beam secures $93M Series B, enters new markets<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Singapore-based micromobility startup Beam secures $93M Series B, enters new markets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/24\/singapore-based-micromobility-startup-beam-secures-93m-series-b-enters-new-markets\/embed\/#?secret=ppr55CsdCy#?secret=94BQBBH5yo\" data-secret=\"94BQBBH5yo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gbike, a South Korea-based micromobility Gcooter operator, is acquiring Hyundai Motor&#8217;s shared micromobility sharing platform\u00a0ZET\u00a0as it wants to increase its market share and create technological synergies via ZET&#8217;s fleet management system.\u00a0 Gbike CEO Walter Yoon told TechCrunch that the deal, which is its first acquisition, will be completed in early August.

The latest probe, like most of the others, seeks to ascertain whether or not Autopilot, Tesla&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system, was in use at the time of the crash.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this month, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/07\/another-fatal-tesla-crash-is-being-investigated-by-u-s-safety-regulators\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NHTSA opened an investigation<\/a> into one such fatal crash in which a pedestrian was killed and involved a 2018 Tesla Model 3 in California. The NHTSA also opened up special probes into another fatal Tesla crash, this one in Florida, which killed a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-07-08\/authorities-to-probe-tesla-crash-in-florida-that-killed-two\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">66-year-old Tesla driver<\/a> and a 67-year-old passenger.

Local news reported that on July 7, a 48-year-old motorcyclist was killed after a collision on the Riverside Freeway in Riverside. He was riding in the HOV lane and was approached from behind by the Tesla. A crash then occurred that hurled the rider onto the freeway, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/mynewsla.com\/riverside\/2022\/07\/07\/motorcyclist-killed-in-collision-with-tesla-on-riverside-freeway\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">My News LA<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p data-testid=\"paragraph-1\">The NHTSA usually opens more than 100 special crash investigations each year that probe emerging technologies.<\/p>\n<p class=\"text__text__1FZLe text__dark-grey__3Ml43 text__regular__2N1Xr text__large__nEccO body__base__22dCE body__large_body__FV5_X article-body__element__2p5pI\" data-testid=\"paragraph-2\">Tesla cannot be reached for comment because it has disbanded its press office.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is opening yet another special investigation into a Tesla vehicle crash, according to documents viewed by TechCrunch.

investors are left wondering whether this latest bull run was all some grand fever dream or whether some of the trends of the past two years spell a new future for the consumer web.<\/p>\n<p>This week on TechCrunch&#8217;s crypto-centric podcast <strong>Chain Reaction<\/strong>, we caught up with Naveen Jain, the creator of a product called Yat, which sells what are essentially emoji shortlinks. Some of these go for a few bucks, others have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the startup has been making bank on the back of the idea of digital ownership, which has gained popularity as a result of the NFT craze.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You can listen to the full episode below:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.simplecast.com\/1668784f-5072-4d74-9c55-979315ba4829?dark=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"200px\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>As the NFT world&#8217;s future gets a bit more cloudy, we talked to Jain about what the lasting importance of owning a &#8220;digital identity&#8221; is and why someone would want to pay to own their own string of emoji characters.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When someone owns something, it says a lot about them &#8212; far more than just, for example, clicking on a like button on some website,&#8221; Jain says. &#8220;So when you own something, it&#8217;s sort of like conviction in that thing, right? You have something at risk potentially. If you own something, you&#8217;ve spent some money or time or whatever it is to own the thing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In our conversation, Jain talks about the importance of ownership and what it means to have a blockchain-stored asset as opposed to soft ownership of something like a social media handle.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;When you go register an account on a traditional social network you don&#8217;t really own the account, and they can shut it down whenever they want. And that happens all the time,&#8221; Jain tells us. &#8220;We think that it&#8217;s really important for people to own their internet identities, just like they do their real-life identities&#8230; Emojis are a universal language. You know, everybody on the planet who&#8217;s connected to the internet speaks emoji, they don&#8217;t all speak English. And you can use these strings of emoji to really tell beautiful stories about yourself that may otherwise be like harder to tell with just a traditional alphanumerical username.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We pressed Jain on whether consumers have proven that they care about ownership of digital assets and what other plans Yat has to build out its web3 opportunities in the future.<\/p>\n<p><em>You can hear more of Jain&#8217;s interview by listening to our latest episode.

to test a new &#8216;add a home&#8217; option to charge for password sharing"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Netflix <a href=\"https:\/\/about.netflix.com\/en\/news\/update-to-paid-sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> today that it will begin testing a new &#8220;add a home&#8221; feature to charge users who share their account with others in select countries. The test marks the streaming giant&#8217;s latest effort toward cracking down on password sharing. The test will prompt users to pay an additional fee if they use an account outside their household. Netflix will begin testing the feature in Argentina, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras next month.<\/p>\n<p>In these test regions, each Netflix account will include one home where you can access Netflix on any of your devices. If you want to allow someone to use your Netflix account in an additional home, the company will ask you to pay a fee. You can add a home to your account by paying an extra 219 pesos in Argentina and $2.99 in the other test regions. Members on a Basic Netflix plan can add one extra home, Standard users can add up to two extra homes and Premium users can add up to three extra homes. Users in these test areas will have the option to control where their account is being used and remove homes from their account settings page.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"article-contentstyles__ArticleQuoteText-pei0rm-9 jfNHbe\">&#8220;It\u2019s great that our members love Netflix movies and TV shows so much they want to share them more broadly,&#8221; said Netflix&#8217;s director of product innovation, Chengyi Long, in a statement. &#8220;But today\u2019s widespread account sharing between households undermines our long term ability to invest in and improve our service.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Netflix says this test expands on<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/16\/netflix-tests-a-new-feature-that-will-raise-prices-for-account-sharing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> a similar feature it launched<\/a> in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru earlier this year called &#8220;add extra member.&#8221; As part of this test, subscribers are asked to pay extra if they are sharing the service with people outside their own household. The feature allows households to add up to two \u201csub accounts\u201d for a fee that\u2019s less than the cost of the full-priced Netflix service.<\/p>\n<p>Netflix had said this solution doesn\u2019t rely on location-based data, like GPS. Instead, it\u2019s leveraging the same information it uses to provide its service today to its end users, including an IP address, device IDs and other information about devices signed into the Netflix account across the household. Through this method, Netflix can identify when there\u2019s persistent sharing taking place outside a household.<\/p>\n<p>The company announced during its first-quarter earnings call that it will <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/19\/netflix-to-charge-global-members-sharing-their-accounts-an-additional-fee-following-tests\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">expand tests that charge members<\/a> a higher price if they\u2019re engaged in account sharing with people outside their household. Netflix had clarified it will need to continue to iterate on the feature for roughly a year or so, to make sure it gets the balance right in terms of how much extra to charge subscribers who have shared their Netflix account with other users outside their own household.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Netflix estimates there are around 100 million households globally sharing their user accounts, and over 30 million of those are in the U.S. and Canada alone. Netflix says that by asking members who are sharing their accounts to pay more, it hopes to strike the right balance between still permitting sharing to take place while also helping to bring in revenue from everyone who\u2019s viewing and getting value from its service.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>These tests aren&#8217;t the only way Netflix is planning to monetize its subscriber base, as the company also said it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/19\/netflix-to-introduce-ad-supporter-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">will introduce an ad-supported plan.<\/a> Last week, Netflix announced that it&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/13\/netflix-partners-with-microsoft-for-its-ad-supported-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">partnering with Microsoft<\/a> as its \u201cglobal advertising technology and sales partner\u201d to help the streaming service earn revenue through ads.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LBNpKSKrSa\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/16\/netflix-tests-a-new-feature-that-will-raise-prices-for-account-sharing\/\">Netflix tests a new feature that will raise prices for account sharing<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Netflix tests a new feature that will raise prices for account sharing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/16\/netflix-tests-a-new-feature-that-will-raise-prices-for-account-sharing\/embed\/#?secret=Oh7HDNLCXi#?secret=LBNpKSKrSa\" data-secret=\"LBNpKSKrSa\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"9hzSWpkqta\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/19\/netflix-to-charge-global-members-sharing-their-accounts-an-additional-fee-following-tests\/\">Netflix says it will eventually charge more if you share your account<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Netflix says it will eventually charge more if you share your account&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/19\/netflix-to-charge-global-members-sharing-their-accounts-an-additional-fee-following-tests\/embed\/#?secret=XxOENI8986#?secret=9hzSWpkqta\" data-secret=\"9hzSWpkqta\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Netflix announced today that it will begin testing a new &#8220;add a home&#8221; feature to charge users who share their account with others in select countries.

Cataracts &#8212; and the surgery to correct them &#8212; is one of the most common surgical procedures in the world, with more than 28 million performed worldwide, every year. The problem is, even though the surgery is relatively simple, there aren&#8217;t enough surgeons, and not enough money to pay those surgeons, especially in developing countries. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forsightrobotics.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ForSight Robotics<\/a> wants to address that issue and just raised a $55 million Series A to continue develop its surgery robots. The round comes around <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/09\/eye-surgery-robotics-startup-forsight-raises-10m\/\">18 months after its seed round<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The surgery robot platform is called Oryom, \u00a0which means \u201cdaylight\u201d in Hebrew. It leverages cutting-edge technologies (pun intended) in microsurgical robotics, computer vision and machine learning. The platform aims to automate ophthalmic surgeries that treat diseases underlying preventable blindness. With the power of robotics on its side, the company claims to be 10 times more accurate than the human hand.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are pleased to be able to advance our technology with this investment to bring robotics into the world of ophthalmic surgery to help millions of patients who have to wait unnecessarily for procedures while their eyesight deteriorates,&#8221; says Daniel Glozman, ForSight CEO and co-founder. &#8220;Our goal is to democratize this highly sophisticated procedure, enabling patients around the world to easily access the treatment that can restore their vision.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>According to the British Journal of Ophthalmology, affluent nations have 72 eye surgeons per million people, while low-income countries average only 3.7 per million. The surgeries could prevent many of the leading causes of blindness. The freshly raised funding will be used to accelerate the development of ForSight&#8217;s platform in clinical trials, with the ultimate goal of benefiting as many patients as possible. The company is expanding its technical team, and shares that it is actively hiring skilled, impact-driven engineers across the mechanical, software and hardware fields.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Worldwide, more than a billion people suffer from vision impairment and entirely avoidable blindness.
